            "Dred Scott v. Sandford,[note 1] 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court held that the United States Constitution was not meant to include American citizenship for people of African descent, regardless of whether they were enslaved or free, and so the rights and privileges that the Constitution confers upon American citizens could not apply to them.[3][4] The Supreme Court's decision has been widely denounced, both for how overtly racist the decision was and its crucial role in the near collapse of the United States of America four years later.[5] Bernard Schwartz said that it \"stands first in any list of the worst Supreme Court decisions—Chief Justice Hughes called it the Court's greatest self-inflicted wound.\"[6] Junius P. Rodriguez said that it is \"universally condemned as the U.S. Supreme Court's worst decision\".[7] Historian David Thomas Konig said that it was \"unquestionably, our court's worst decision ever.\"[8]\n",
            "The decision was made in the case of Dred Scott, an enslaved black man whose owners had taken him from Missouri, a slave-holding state, into Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory, where slavery was illegal. When his owners later brought him back to Missouri, Scott sued in court for his freedom and claimed that because he had been taken into \"free\" U.S. territory, he had automatically been freed and was legally no longer a slave. Scott sued first in Missouri state court, which ruled that he was still a slave under its law. He then sued in U.S. federal court, which ruled against him by deciding that it had to apply Missouri law to the case. He then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n",
            "In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision against Dred Scott. In an opinion written by Chief Justice Roger Taney, the Court ruled that people of African descent \"are not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word 'citizens' in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States\". Taney supported his ruling with an extended survey of American state and local laws from the time of the Constitution's drafting in 1787 that purported to show that a \"perpetual and impassable barrier was intended to be erected between the white race and the one which they had reduced to slavery\". Because the Court ruled that Scott was not an American citizen, he was also not a citizen of any state and, accordingly, could never establish the \"diversity of citizenship\" that Article III of the U.S. Constitution requires for a U.S. federal court to be able to exercise jurisdiction over a case.[3] After ruling on those issues surrounding Scott, Taney continued further and struck down the entire Missouri Compromise as a limitation on slavery that exceeded the U.S. Congress's constitutional powers.\n",

This can be further divided into two ways of research. First, what are the judges' opinions and tendencies on different types of cases? Also, are some of them more strict than their peers, or oppositely, do they incline to be more lenient on particular cases? By answering the questions, I may be able to find out the trends or even biases in justice governance."

Furthermore, in the juridical system, law firms are still relying on the traditional way to analyze and win a case, while I am wondering what the machine can do and change the environment in this field. The second question could be seen as the transition of adjudication with topic modeling: how do the judgment, people's interpretations, feelings, and understandings of law, etc., change over time? This question can be useful for the reformatting or revolution of the juridical system. Since the court system is complicated in the U.S.: Federal and State courts, and both have three layers of courts, I can scale up my analysis on this basis, or even just targeting those 'high-profile' cases would be abundant enough to showcase the findings."
